All candidates for this position must have experience specifically in the use of data in web applications.

An ideal candidate will demonstrate competency in the following areas:
•	Propensity for fast prototyping. If we’re building a dashboard, we’d rather use some library like keen.github.io/dashboards that does most of what we want in one day than a custom-built solution that does everything we want in one month.
•	High competence in at least one web-based data visualization library. Currently we favor the idea of using Bokeh (bokeh.pydata.org) because it is integrated with Python (and therefore our entire analytic stack), leverages Javascript and server-side processing (for easy in-browser visualization), and renders in Canvas (good performance). We’re willing to reassess our preference if you feel strongly about and can argue coherently for d3, just-plain Javascript, or some other alternative.
•	Very good Javascript skills. We’d love to see some live examples of your work.
•	Experience with simple gamification on the order of what you see on a Stack Exchange site: reputation, badges, tags, etc. We’re trying to figure out how to streamline the process for identifying and prioritizing needs across the organization. We think Stack Exchange is a good model for that. If you have a better idea, we’d like to hear about it.
•	Database management skills are a plus.
•	A background in Python based web-development is a definite plus.  We prefer lighter-weight frameworks (all other things being equal, we’d take Flask over Django), but that’s negotiable.
•	Experience with Python analytic stack (Pandas, Numpy, etc.) is a plus, as that will smooth interactions with the analytic portion of the team.
In addition, the following characteristics are required to be successful on this team:
•	Curiosity and ambition. We don’t just need someone to implement our specs. We need someone to partner with the data collectors and scientists on our team to invent new ways to drive education and management decisions.
•	Focus on minimum viable products. We want to build the simplest possible tool that can still accomplish its intended task. We’ll expand and enhance that tool over time as we get user feedback and see implementation results.
•	Commitment to the user. We need you to memorize this: “If the user experience is bad, it doesn’t matter that my code was good.” It’s not enough that you be ok with that principle. We need you to be absolutely committed to it.
•	Flexibility. You will move from project to project with very little warning. Long hours and weekends will sometimes be necessary.
•	Dedication to mission. We’re looking for someone who has a genuine interest in finding ways to improve public education and support our schools.
•	Collaboration. You will need to work closely with many different people, most of whom have no technical background.
•	Vision. We need you to form very strong opinions about how the organization needs to consume analysis. We want someone who can help us build what we envision now, and then help us learn what to envision next.To be eligible for the LMI Leadership Forum, you must:
• Be a current, full-time, undergraduate student in your sophomore year of study.
• Demonstrate leadership qualities on campus or in your community.
• Have a strong interest in the insurance industry.
• Have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher.
• Be a U.S. Citizen or permanent resident.-BA or equivalent with emphasis on coursework of a quantitative nature, preferably Economics, Mathematics, or Statistics
-Superior Excel skills: comfort with pivot tables is a MUST. You pivot in your sleep.
-Experience in working with large datasets and performing quantitative analysis
-Demonstrated critical thinking ability
-Proven ability to manage multiple projects at a time while paying strict attention to detail
-Self-starter who is comfortable with a rapidly-changing environment
-Energetic, relentless drive to succeed, TEAM player•	Bachelor of Science/Business Administration or MBA with a concentration in Healthcare; BA/BS in Health Information Management (HIM), Nursing, Business or Accounting (MS/MA/MBA degree is a plus) 
•	Strong academic credentials (Minimum GPA of 3.2)
•	Relevant work experience (e.g. internships, summer positions, school jobs) 
•	Demonstrated leadership, problem solving, and strong verbal and written communication skills
•	Ability to prioritize tasks, work on multiple assignments, and manage ambiguity 
•	Ability to work both independently and as part of a team with professionals at all levels 
•	Ability to travel 75%*** If you are interested in helping our family, please tell us about yourself---we love working with Cal students, but the downside is that our helpers' schedules are always changing so we're almost always looking for new helpers!***

About Us:

The User Experience Design group at Constant Contact is much more than a production crew. We are a fundamental and strategically critical part of the business, one of the core pillars of the product organization. We help establish a strategic direction for the company. We are a world-class team of designers, coders, writers, and researchers.

We work hard to make the world a better place by helping SMBs survive and thrive in the diverse and ever-changing online ecosystem. We’re a close-knit group that sometimes has a little too much fun. We’re recovering perfectionists who have learned to fail forward and move fast. Most of all, we love what we do.

Start Date:
•Spring 2015Here at Constant Contact, we believe that if you offer challenging projects to smart people, and give them the freedom to invent, you can create powerful solutions while being part of a fun, collaborative environment. We are looking for future database administration professionals at all levels that love what they do and are great at it.The Dean is an integral member of our school leadership team. The perfect Dean candidate is the school principal’s right hand person ensuring that all of our scholars and families are in school, dressed for success, with their completed homework in hand. All of our teachers are teaching like their ‘hair is on fire’ and hustling to ensure that every scholar is engaged and getting the absolute most out of every minute of instruction. To excel at this job, you need to possess:

•	Excellent judgment: This position requires quick decision-making and excellent judgment. You need to make critical decisions quickly and accurately.
•	Relentless attention to detail: Is a scholar wearing the wrong color socks?
•	Time-management prowess: No two days are alike in this position. You need to be able to deal with multiple issues simultaneously, ensure that no balls are dropped, and ensure that everyone is responded to and addressed in a timely fashion.
•	Direct, yet supportive conversations: You need to be able to lead tough, but supportive conversations with families and teachers.
•	Flawless classroom management: You have to be able to walk into any room and assess a teacher’s classroom management and coach him/her in the moment to move from his/her practice from good to great.

•	Natural ability with students: In the beginning of the year, a good portion of your job is spent working directly with scholars. You have to have a tremendous knack in calming elementary students down and ensuring they understand the rules and know how to follow the rules. This isn’t always easy with 5-year-olds!
•	Persistence: This job is hard. Your first solution won’t always work, so you have to have an arsenal of tactics to address tardies, reading log completion, family academic event attendance, teachers not noticing uniform infractions, and classroom management tactics that just aren’t sticking.
•	Drive for Excellence: 96% doesn’t cut it. We want 100% on everything we do. You have to have incredibly high expectations and have to be willing to put in the work to achieve 100% every time.
•	Creativity: Every scholar, every family, and every teacher is unique. As such, you need to approach every situation differently and have different solutions for the same issues. This takes creativity!Part-time or full time student

Top 5 reasons why San Luis Obispo is so HAPPY
We’ve all heard (thanks to National Geographic and Oprah Winfrey) that San Luis Obispo is the happiest place in America. But, really, why is that? Is there something in the water that makes every resident feel a bit more contented than residents of other towns? Is it the way we treat each other? Is it the fact that we are surrounded by open spaces? Maybe. Here are a few reasons why we think San Luis Obispo (or SLO, to locals) is the happiest place in America. 
1.        San Luis Obispo is social.    It was meant to be a joke when actress Jenny McCarthy said it on the Oprah segment, but it is true.  In San Luis Obispo our version of social media is being social!  We love the outdoors, hanging out with friends, spending time downtown and of course, what else, happy hours.  
2.        San Luis Obispo truly has farm to table lifestyle.   There are four farmers markets in San Luis Obispo every week and one every day of the week throughout the county, so access to fresh foods is easy.  Not to mention that SLO is home to some of the most amazing restaurants, world-class chefs and finest wines anywhere.  
3.        San Luis Obispo is happily active.   San Luis Obispo was recently cited as one of the most active cities in the nation. Many residents bike and walk to work every day.  There are more than 6,500 acres of protected open space for hiking, biking and yearlong outdoor activities. 
4.        San Luis Obispo supports the arts.  Residents love their art – from performance art to the visual arts. San Luis Obispo is home to the Christopher Cohan Performing Arts Center, a state-of-the-art performance facility that exposes the Central Coast to varied, high quality arts events designed to serve diverse audience interests.
5.        San Luis Obispo weather is as pleasant as it gets.  San Luis Obispo County has one of the world’s most comfortable climates. The weather is perfect 306 days of the year. While more than half of the country is trekking through snow, ice, sleet and rain this time of year, we’re enjoying perfect 75 degree weather without a cloud in the sky. Sure, it rains here, and we have our moments of unpleasant weather, but for most of the year, we enjoy beautiful sunny skies and a moderate climate. The summers here are delightfully mild, with daytime highs usually in the low 80s, and cool evenings. Winters are even better with daytime highs in the 60s and 70s, and crisp, clear nights. Frost is rare, snow almost unheard of. (A dusting of snow always makes the front page of the local paper.) This perfect weather allows us to be more social and active when residents of other cities in the nation are holed up inside.

•	Full support of the mission and vision of UniversalGiving™Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm with a unique focus on technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to guide our business. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. We are a global liquidity provider and market maker, operating around the clock and around the globe, employing over 380 people in our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong. 

The markets change rapidly, and we need to change faster still. Every day, we come to work with new problems to solve, new systems to build and new theories to test.  We’re always looking for people to join us and help come up with that next great idea. Our trading is based on our own proprietary models and on busy days we engage in over a million trades. Technology is at the core of how we approach trading, and we consider ourselves as much a technology company as a trading firm. We use OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language, and have the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting. 

You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main website (http://janestreet.com). You can also look at a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61),  and our programming blog (http://ocaml.janestreet.com).Jane Street is looking to hire great software developers and quantitative researchers with an interest in functional programming.

Software Developers:
OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and  SML, is our language of choice. We use OCaml for running our entire business,  supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.

Quantitative Researchers:
The research group at Jane Street builds models and systems for pricing and trading financial assets. Though our work is mathematically motivated, we spend most of our time coding--building systems to analyze large volumes of data, and studying and tuning our trading systems. We are looking for candidates with exceptional mathematical aptitude and hacking ability. We work mostly in OCaml, but it's fine if you have zero prior OCaml experience.

Interns are given the opportunity to engage in software and research projects that have real and lasting impact.  Some examples of projects that interns have worked on include:

- Developed a data analysis tool to provide traders with new insight into the competitive landscape of the market.
- Wrote a program to analyze how the statistical properties of asset prices vary as a function of the time of day.
- Simulated and analyzed a futures trading strategy.
- Wrote a robust linear regression library and command-line tool
- Built market data visualization tools, using js_of_ocaml to compile OCaml code into javascript to run on the browser.
- Extended the the Async concurrency library to implement the tail-recursion optimization.
- Wrote a protocol compiler for generating high-performance code for serializing and  deserializing network messages.


Also, interns take part in our electronic mock trading training program, where they work in small teams to develop automated strategies on our mock exchange platform.At Continuuity, you will work on challenging, previously unsolved distributed-systems problems while building our bleeding edge, Big Data application server. You will apply your knowledge of software design principles, system programming, algorithms, data structure and many other programming skills. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and work with many vibrant Open Source communities. While collaborating with some of the leading minds in Big Data, combined with a great environment that reflects our cultural values (empowerment, trust, fearlessness, teamwork, and excellence), you will experience and learn what it means to be an entrepreneur. You will be involved in creating sales pitches, collateral, proof-of-concepts, and customer engagement associated with your work. You will have the chance to make a huge impact on a growing company.**  Please also apply directly on Twitter's job site at the following link: https://about.twitter.com/careers/positions?jvi=ogZeZfwc,Job  **
